-- FINAL COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY LOCKDOWN
-- Address all remaining security vulnerabilities identified in the scan

-- 1. FIX APPLICATIONS TABLE - Force use of safe view only
-- Remove direct access to applications table to prevent personal data exposure
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Employers can view limited application data" ON public.applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Candidates can view their own applications" ON public.applications;

-- Create highly restrictive policies that force use of safe views
CREATE POLICY "No direct application reading" 
ON public.applications 
FOR SELECT 
USING (false); -- Block all direct SELECT access

-- Keep insert policies as they are needed for functionality
-- Candidates and guests can still create applications

-- 2. FIX RESUMES TABLE - Integrate with resume_access properly
-- Remove overly permissive candidate access and implement proper resume access control
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Candidates can view their own resumes" ON public.resumes;

-- Create proper policies that respect the resume_access system
CREATE POLICY "Candidates can view their own resumes" 
ON public.resumes 
FOR SELECT 
USING (candidate_id = auth.uid());

-- Add policy for users with resume access permissions
CREATE POLICY "Users with resume access can view resumes" 
ON public.resumes 
FOR SELECT 
USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL 
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM resume_access ra 
    WHERE ra.user_id = auth.uid() 
    AND ra.has_access = true
  )
);

-- 3. FIX EVENTS TABLE - Restrict event creation to authenticated users only
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "events_insert_all" ON public.events;

-- Only authenticated users can create events
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create events" 
ON public.events 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Service role can also create events (for system events)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can create events" 
ON public.events 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 4. FIX APPLY_AUDIT TABLE - Restrict to service role only
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "apply_audit_insert" ON public.apply_audit;

-- Only service role can insert audit records (via edge functions)
CREATE POLICY "Service role only audit inserts" 
ON public.apply_audit 
FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- 5. CREATE SAFE VIEWS FOR APPLICATIONS ACCESS
-- Employers should use this view instead of direct table access
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.applications_for_employers AS
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.vacancy_id,
  a.applied_by,
  a.message,
  a.resume_id,
  a.resume_file_url,
  a.resume_link,
  a.created_at,
  -- Minimal contact info for guest applications only
  CASE 
    WHEN a.applied_by = 'guest' THEN a.guest_name
    ELSE 'Зарегистрированный кандидат'
  END as applicant_display_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN a.applied_by = 'guest' THEN a.guest_email  
    ELSE NULL
  END as contact_email,
  a.candidate_id
FROM public.applications a
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM vacancies v 
  WHERE v.id = a.vacancy_id 
  AND v.employer_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Enable security invoker
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.applications_for_employers
WITH (security_invoker = true) AS
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.vacancy_id,
  a.applied_by,
  a.message,
  a.resume_id,
  a.resume_file_url,
  a.resume_link,
  a.created_at,
  -- Minimal contact info for guest applications only
  CASE 
    WHEN a.applied_by = 'guest' THEN a.guest_name
    ELSE 'Зарегистрированный кандидат'
  END as applicant_display_name,
  CASE 
    WHEN a.applied_by = 'guest' THEN a.guest_email  
    ELSE NULL
  END as contact_email,
  a.candidate_id
FROM public.applications a
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM vacancies v 
  WHERE v.id = a.vacancy_id 
  AND v.employer_id = auth.uid()
);

-- Grant access to authenticated users (they still need RLS checks in the view)
GRANT SELECT ON public.applications_for_employers TO authenticated;

-- 6. CREATE SAFE VIEW FOR CANDIDATES TO SEE THEIR APPLICATIONS
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.applications_for_candidates
WITH (security_invoker = true) AS
SELECT 
  id,
  vacancy_id,
  applied_by,
  message,
  resume_id,
  resume_file_url,
  resume_link,
  created_at,
  candidate_id
FROM public.applications
WHERE candidate_id = auth.uid();

GRANT SELECT ON public.applications_for_candidates TO authenticated;

-- 7. ADD COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY COMMENTS
COMMENT ON TABLE public.applications IS 'Direct access blocked. Use applications_for_employers or applications_for_candidates views.';
COMMENT ON TABLE public.events IS 'Only authenticated users and service role can create events.';
COMMENT ON TABLE public.apply_audit IS 'Audit trail - service role access only for integrity.';

COMMENT ON VIEW public.applications_for_employers IS 'Safe employer view - minimal personal data, SECURITY INVOKER';
COMMENT ON VIEW public.applications_for_candidates IS 'Safe candidate view - own applications only, SECURITY INVOKER';
